To collect data from YouTube, you need to set up an API. Here are the steps you can follow:

Go to Google Cloud Console.
Click on the project drop-down at the top, then “New Project”.
Enter a project name and click “Create”.
In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to “APIs & Services” > “Library”.
Search for “YouTube Data API v3” and click on it.
Click “Enable”.
Go to “APIs & Services” > “Credentials”.
Click “+ CREATE CREDENTIALS” and select “API key”.
Copy the generated API key.

Conclusion
So, here’s my conclusion on what makes a video trend on YouTube:

Encourage viewers to like and comment on videos to boost engagement metrics.
Aim to create shorter videos (under 5 minutes) for higher engagement, especially for categories like Music and Entertainment.
Schedule video uploads around peak times (2 PM – 8 PM) to maximize initial views and engagement.
